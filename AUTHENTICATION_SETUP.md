   }
   ```
   (Replace with appropriate role: ADMIN, CLUB, or PLAYER)

6. Click "Create User"
7. Repeat for each demo account

## üîß Manual Profile Updates (if needed)

If you need to manually update user profiles after creation, run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql

UPDATE public.profiles 
SET club_id = '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111'
WHERE email = 'manager@pinevalleygc.com';

UPDATE public.profiles 
SET club_id = '22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222' 
WHERE email = 'manager@oakridgecc.com';
```
