# Player Journey Testing Guide v2.0

## Pre-Testing Checklist ‚úÖ

All critical issues have been resolved:
- ‚úÖ Database schema (slugs, user_roles, competition status)
- ‚úÖ Edge functions (send-branded-magic-link, verify-magic-link)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies and security
- ‚úÖ Entry context persistence
- ‚úÖ Safe data access functions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor: Password protection disabled (auth setting - doesn't block testing)

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Initial System Health Check
1. Visit `/dashboard/admin` - verify you can access admin dashboard
2. Check browser console for any critical errors
3. Verify auth state shows as SUPER_ADMIN
4. Test basic navigation between admin pages

### 2. Demo Data Preparation
1. Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Quick Actions ‚Üí "Reset Demo Data"
2. Verify demo clubs and competitions are created
3. Check that at least one active competition exists
